# Relearning-Coding-2025  

I am relearning how to code, starting with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and expanding into more technologies like **TailwindCSS** and **React**. This repository will serve as a place to document my progress and practice.  

## 📚 Goals  
- To build a strong foundation in web development.  
- To practice coding through tasks, projects, and real-world examples.  
- To explore advanced tools and frameworks as I progress.  

## 🗂️ Repository Structure  
The repository is organized into the following:  
1. **Topics**: Focused exercises and concepts for foundational knowledge (e.g., Flexbox, Grid, DOM manipulation).  
2. **Tasks**: Specific coding challenges or exercises.  
3. **Projects**: Mini-projects and applications to apply what I've learned.  

## 🔧 Technologies  
I’ll begin with:  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

Later, I plan to explore:  
- TailwindCSS  
- React  
- More tools and frameworks as I progress.  

## 🌐 Resources  
I’ll be following resources from:  
- **YouTube** tutorials  
- Online courses  
- Websites like [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) and [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com).  

## 🤝 Contributions  
Currently, this is a personal learning project. Contributions might be welcomed in the future as I grow more confident in managing collaborative work.  

## 🚀 Progress Tracking  
As of now, I’ll focus on learning and improving. I’ll update this README with live demos or screenshots once I start showcasing projects.
