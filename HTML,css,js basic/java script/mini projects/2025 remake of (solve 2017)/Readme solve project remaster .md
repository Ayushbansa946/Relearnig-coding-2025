# Solve Project: 2025 Remake/Remaster  

Welcome to the **2025 remake/remaster** of the 2016 **Solve Project**!  

This project is a modernized version of the original **Solve Project**, a **JavaScript-based puzzle game** that I first created in 2016 during a 6-month training program after completing my 12th grade and before entering university. Back then, this was my very first mini-project, and it holds a special place in my coding journey.  

---

## 🎮 Project Overview  

The original Solve Project was a **3x3 grid puzzle game** where users had to rearrange jumbled image tiles to form a complete picture. It was a fun and challenging project that helped me grasp JavaScript fundamentals and introduced me to problem-solving with code.

## 🌟 Why the Remake?  

In 2025, I’ve decided to revisit this project for two key reasons:  

1. **Professional Growth**:  
   After a **4-year career break** (2020–2024) due to personal reasons, this project serves as a way for me to rebuild my skills and regain confidence as a developer.  

2. **Modernization**:  
   - To refactor and modernize the code with best practices.  
   - To improve code structure while preserving the nostalgic look and feel of the original project.

## 🚀 2025 Update Plan  

### 🔄 Key Updates (Version 1.1)

  - Separate JavaScript scripts into external files.  
  - Organize files into appropriate folders (e.g., `css/`, `Script/`, `images/`).  

- **Modern Practices**:  
  - Use modern JavaScript syntax and features.  
  - Ensure cleaner, modular code.  

- **Preserving Original Aesthetic**:  
  - Maintain the **bare minimum CSS** to preserve the original look and feel.  
  - Focus primarily on functionality improvements.  

### 🔧 Planned Future Versions  
- Enhance user experience with subtle, modern improvements.  
- Add documentation for better understanding of the code.  
- Optimize performance for better gameplay experience.

## 🤔 Why This Matters  

Revisiting this project allows me to reflect on my growth as a developer and showcase how far I’ve come since my early coding days.  
It also serves as an excellent practice project to sharpen my skills after taking a **4-year career break** (2020–2024). By modernizing the Solve Project, I aim to strike a balance between preserving its nostalgic charm and making it relevant for today’s web development standards.
